It always strikes me that the problem with many economists is that they try to equate economics with hard sciences like chemistry and physics, whose equations and formulae have predictive power.</p> <p>It seems to me much more akin to a social science. It describes economic systems and can sometimes express them in mathematical terns, but the origins of what it describes are social, political and historical, and are malleable.
