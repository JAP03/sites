I can&#8217;t imagine being outside but this is the business we&#8217;re in and we have to do it the hard way,&#8221;¬† Orlando Hernandez, Big M Car Wash, said.</p>\n<p>We bundle up our bodies when the temperature drops but many New Yorkers have paid the price by leaving precious electronics out in the bitter blast.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s usually in my pocket so I guess it stays warm with my hands,&#8221; one smartphone user said.</p>\n<p>Experts say cell phones, laptops, and tablets can be seriously damaged if left out in the cold.</p>\n<p>Chris Jelani of ATT Greenvale told CBS 2 that leaving electronics out can shorten the life of the lithium-ion battery, crack internal components, and cause harmful condensation in anything with a LCD screen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of people when they grab an electronic from a car or pocket if it&#8217;s not working they tap harder which can easily crack it,&#8221; Jelani said.</p>\n<p>At the P.C. Richard And Son in Greenvale there has been an uptick in service calls for cold exposure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Leaving it in your car is a &#8216;no no&#8217;. Same goes for any GPS system you may have. Smartphones, tablets, you definitely want to take it with you,&#8221; Chris Gabriel explained.</p>\n<p>Lap tops are also vulnerable and hard drives can freeze.</p>\n<p>Experts recommend carrying a portable phone charger to make up for reduced battery life and keeping that phone in your pocket to protect it from the bitter chill.</p>\n<p>If you drop your phone in the snow experts suggest taking the battery and the sim card out, bringing the phone indoors, and letting it dry out before powering it up.</p>\n<p>Manufacturers also provide temporal guidelines. Apple says that its products can operate in temperatures between 32 and 95 degrees.</p>\n<p><b>You May Also Be Interested In These Stories</b><br />\n<ul class="display-posts-listing"><li class="listing-item"><a class="title" href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/08/long-island-residents-outraged-after-county-parks-parking-lot-rented-to-used-car-dealership/">Long Island Residents Outraged After County Park&#8217;s Parking Lot Rented To Used Car&nbsp;Dealership</a></li><li class="listing-item"><a class="title" href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/08/nypd-questioning-woman-in-death-of-4-year-old-boy/">Police Questioning Woman In Death Of 4-Year-Old&nbsp;Boy</a></li><li class="listing-item"><a class="title" href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/08/inwood-restaurant-owner-fights-to-keep-mothers-killers-behind-bars/">Inwood Restaurant Owner Fights To Keep Mother&#8217;s Killer Behind&nbsp;Bars</a></li><li class="listing-item"><a class="title" href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/08/email-from-christie-aide-called-for-traffic-problems-in-fort-lee-ahead-of-gwb-lane-closures/">Christie &#8216;Outraged&#8217; By &#8216;Unacceptable&#8217; Email Exchanges Over GWB Lane&nbsp;Closures</a></li></ul></p><br />Filed under: <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/news/consumer/\'>Consumer</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/news/consumer-news/\'>Consumer News</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/watch-listen/heard-on-1010-wins-wcbs-wfan/\'>Heard On 1010 WINS, WCBS, WFAN</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/news/lifestyle/\'>Lifestyle</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/news/local/\'>Local</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/news/\'>News</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/watch-listen/seen-on-cbs-2hd/\'>Seen On CBS 2HD</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/syndicated-local/\'>Syndicated Local</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/syndication/\'>Syndication</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/watch/\'>Watch</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/watch-listen/\'>Watch + Listen</a> Tagged: <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/apple/\'>Apple</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/carolyn-gusoff/\'>Carolyn Gusoff</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/electronics/\'>electronics</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/ipad/\'>iPad</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/iphone/\'>iPhone</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/orlando-hernandez/\'>Orlando Hernandez</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/cbsnewyork.wordpress.com/799491/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/cbsnewyork.wordpress.com/799491/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=newyork.cbslocal.com&#038;blog=14578484&#038;post=799491&#038;subd=cbsnewyork&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />',MediaRSS:{Title:null,Description:null,Copyright:null,Keywords:null,Rating:null,Thumbnails:[],Player:null,Contents:[{Url:'http://cbsnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/iphone_with_ios7.jpg?w=300',Filesize:0,Type:null,Medium:'image',IsDefault:true,Expression:null,Bitrate:0,Framerate:0,Samplerate:0,Channels:0,Duration:0,Height:168,Width:300,Language:null}],Credits:[]},GeoRSS:{Point:null,Line:null,Polygon:null,Box:null,Floor:null,Radius:null,Elevation:null,FeatureType:null,Relationship:null,FeatureName:null},Topics:[],PostId:24559562948,PubDate:new Date(1389227906000),FeedName:'CBS New York',Title:'Blast Of Arctic Temperatures Could Put Your Electronics On Thin Ice',HtmlUrl:'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/08/blast-of-arctic-temperatures-could-put-your-electronics-on-thin-ice/',Guid:'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/?p=799491',Author:'mjmontone',EnclosureUrl:'',EnclosureType:'',FeedId:688080,CommentRss:''},{Description:'<p><strong>NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) &#8211;</strong>¬†The New Jersey Devils and Philadelphia 76ers have become the first major U.S.-based professional teams to sign a sponsorship deal with an online gambling company.</p>\n<p>Scott O&#8217;Neil, the chief executive of the Josh Harris-owned teams, and Norbert Teufelberger, the chief executive of bwin.party digital entertainment that operates partypoker, confirmed the multiyear agreement in a statement Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>A news conference is scheduled for Thursday at the Prudential Center to formally announce the deal.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg was first to report the deal.</p>\n<p>New Jersey authorized Internet gambling last year to give a boost to Atlantic City&#8217;s struggling casino industry, which has been beset by increasing competition for the past seven years. It began with a five-day trial period on Nov. 21 and launched publicly on Nov. 25.</p>\n<p>As of Monday, 148,487 accounts had been created, though the state&#8217;s Gaming Enforcement Division notes that individuals often create separate accounts on more than one site.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are proud to welcome partypoker to our family as we embark on an exciting journey with an innovative, global leader in the digital marketplace&#8221; O&#8217;Neil said. &#8220;As an organization, we will continue to align with brands that aspire to grow with us, in true partnership.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teufelberger said his company was excited to offer Devils and Sixers&#8217; fans great digital content and unique game-day experiences.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They are two of the most iconic names in American hockey and basketball with huge and loyal fan bases throughout New Jersey and the surrounding metropolitan areas,&#8221; Teufelberger said. &#8220;There is an affinity between playing in online poker tournaments and sports &#8212; winning is about having intense focus, stamina and a great competitive spirit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Neither the NHL nor the NBA had a problem with the teams having a sponsorship agreement with an online gambling company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As long as the gambling site doesn&#8217;t include sports gambling or sports betting, it&#8217;s now allowed within our rules,&#8221; NBA vice president Mark Tatum said in a statement sent by the league to The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>Online betting marks the biggest expansion of gambling in New Jersey since the first Atlantic City casino opened in 1978. The state lets gamblers play any of the games offered in its 12 casinos, including card games and slots, but online poker has proven especially popular in the early going.</p>\n<p>Harris and business partner David Blitzer bought the Devils and the lease to the Prudential Center from Jeff Vanderbeek for $320 million this summer.</p>\n<p>A New York-based leveraged buyout specialist, Harris bought the Sixers from Comcast-Spectacor in 2011. Blitzer, a senior managing director of The Blackstone Group, was also in that group along with Art Wrubel and Jason Levien.</p>\n<p>News of the sponsorship deal laid to rest that the &#8220;huge annoucement&#8221; set for Thursday, as stated by the Devils&#8217; official Twitter account, had anything to do with the relocation of the franchises.</p>\n<p>The news conference will start at 4 p.m. prior to the Devils&#8217; game against the Dallas Stars.</p>\n<p>O&#8217;Neil will be in attendance with former players from both teams.</p>\n<p>Representing the Devils: Ken Daneyko, Bruce Driver, Jim Dowd and Grant Marshall.

Smith as much as two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>That was in the midst of his shooting woes, but before a recent embarrassing episode that left the Knicks red-faced and Smith $50,000 lighter in the wallet.</p>\n<p>Smith landed himself in coach Mike Woodson&#8217;s doghouse by ignoring a league warning and attempting to repeat the hoax of unlacing an opponent&#8217;s shoes during a game, CBSSports reported. Smith successfully untied Shawn Marion&#8217;s shoe during a 92-80 victory over Dallas on Sunday and received a warning from the league. In an 89-85 victory over Detroit on Tuesday night, Smith attempted the same trick on Greg Monroe &#8212; unsuccessfully, <a title="J.R.

He&#8217;s been brutal this season, struggling with injuries and inconsistency &#8212; not to mention bouts with the organization over his professionalism stemming from the Knicks cutting his younger brother, Chris Smith, to create a roster spot for Jeremy Tyler.</p>\n<p>J.R. Smith was a revelation last season, being named Sixth Man of the Year after averaging 18.3 points as a fine second option for the Knicks next to <a title="Keidel: Considering What Melo Is, Would Blake Be So¬†Bad?" href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/08/keidel-considering-what-melo-is-would-blake-be-so-bad/">Carmelo Anthony</a>. However, the 28-year-old shooting guard is shooting less than 35 percent from the floor and averaging just 11.3 points per game this season.</p>\n<p>The Knicks entered play Wednesday 12-22 and are in dire need of some kind of personnel shake-up. Smith&#8217;s refusal to get with the program has contributed to the front office&#8217;s struggles to move him, CBSSports.com reported.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hear Shanghai has a spot,&#8221; one rival GM said Wednesday when polled about potential takers for Smith.</p>\n<p>Another executive, when asked about teams that might be interested, texted, &#8220;Erie?&#8221; the website reported.</p>\n<p><b>You May Also Be Interested In These Stories</b></p>\n<p><b><ul class="display-posts-listing"><li class="listing-item"><a class="title" href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/08/texas-am-quarterback-manziel-to-enter-nfl-draft/">Texas A&amp;M QB Manziel To Enter NFL&nbsp;Draft</a></li><li class="listing-item"><a class="title" href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/08/silverman-olympic-hockey-may-be-superb-but-it-simply-makes-no-sense/">Silverman: Olympic Hockey May Be Superb, But It Simply Makes No&nbsp;Sense</a></li><li class="listing-item"><a class="title" href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/08/baseball-writers-send-maddux-glavine-and-thomas-to-cooperstown/">Baseball Writers Send Maddux, Glavine And Thomas To&nbsp;Cooperstown</a></li><li class="listing-item"><a class="title" href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/08/0-for-2-mike-piazza-snubbed-by-hall-voters-again/">0 For 2: Mike Piazza Snubbed By Hall Voters&nbsp;Again</a></li></ul></b></p><br />Filed under: <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/sports/knicks/\'>Knicks</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/sports/nba/\'>NBA</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/sports/\'>Sports</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/syndicated-sports/\'>Syndicated Sports</a>, <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/category/syndication/\'>Syndication</a> Tagged: <a href=\'http://newyork.cbslocal.com/tag/j-r-smith/\'>J.R.
